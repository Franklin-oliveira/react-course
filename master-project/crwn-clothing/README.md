## Notes

### Styling with SASS

For styling, I'm using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). To use it, it's necessary to add node-sass to the project by running the command (according to your default package manager): 

```shell
npm add node-sass

# or

yarn add node-sass
```

> `create-react-app` includes some presets of Babel and Webpack to work with SASS right out of the box. So, it is only necessary to add the `node-sass` package to your project.
